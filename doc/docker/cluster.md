# Docker cluster deployment

## Cluster deployment

For a clustered multi node deployment an orchestrator like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) or [Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) is recommended.
As a _reference_ a Docker compose is included. It creates an OpenQuake Engine cluster with **dynamic scaling capabilities**:

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.celery.yml up
```

Containers can be also started in background using `$ docker-compose up -d`.

More workers can be started via

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.celery.yml up --scale worker=N
```
where `N` is the number of expected worker containers.


### Using ZMQ instead of Celery (experimental)

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --scale worker=N
```

### Shared directory

Starting with the OpenQuake Engine 3.3 a [shared directory](../installing/cluster.md) must exists between the master node and workers. Docker compose already set a shared volume between containers ([docker-compose.yml#L36](../../docker/docker-compose.yml#L36)).
When running containers on different hosts (which should be the case) you must adjust `docker-compose.yml` properly to use a shared storage backend.
A configuration example for NFS is provided via the `oqdata-nfs` volume in [docker-compose.yml#L71](../../docker/docker-compose.yml#L71).
